/**
 * WhoDidIt Model Behavior
 *
 * Handles created_by, modified_by fields for a given Model, if they exist in the Model DB table.
 * It's similar to the created, modified automagic, but it stores the logged User id
 * in the models that actAs = array('WhoDidIt')
 * 
 * This is useful to track who created records, and the last user that has changed them
